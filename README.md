# Reactor Count SFSE Plugin

[Everything's on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1169).

# Building

Made with VS 2022 (v143).

- Clone this repo.
- Init submodules. (`git submodule update --init`)
- Clone [Base-Dll-Proxy](https://github.com/Synthlight/Base-Dll-Proxy) into the **same level** as this repo.

i.e. you should have a directory with:
```
\Parent Dir
...\This Repo
...\Base-Dll-Proxy
```

Open in VS and have fun.
